# SHAPEAI PYTHON AND COMPUTER VISION BOOTCAMP
Hi I made this project during the 7 days free bootcamp,conducted by <b> SHAPEAI
</b>
The instructor during the session was Mr. Shaurya Sinha (a Data Analyst at Jio). I got to 
learn a lot during these days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI.
<br>I got to have hand on experience on:
<li>Python basics
<li>Computer vision
<br>during these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that anyone 
with zero experience on programming can learn.
I enjoyed these 7 Days, you can as well.To register for next 7 days bootcamp, visit:
